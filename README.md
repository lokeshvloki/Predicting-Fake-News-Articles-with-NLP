# <b>Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning</b>

A supervised machine learning project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**.

## 🧠 Objective

In the era of rapid information dissemination, identifying misinformation has become critically important. This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline that can effectively distinguish between authentic and fake news articles based on their textual content.

## 📚 Technologies & Libraries

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `NumPy`
  - `Pandas`
  - `re` (Regular Expressions)
  - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - `scikit-learn` (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, Model Evaluation)

---

## 📦 Dataset

- **Source**: [train.csv] *(Replace with actual link or source)*
- **Description**: Contains labeled news articles with the following key columns:
  - `title`: Title of the news article
  - `text`: Full article content
  - `label`: Target variable (0 = Real, 1 = Fake)

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removal of punctuation and non-alphabetic characters using Regular Expressions
- Tokenization of text data
- Stopword removal using NLTK
- Word stemming using `PorterStemmer`

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Text data is transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization** for better representation in a machine learning model.

### 3. Model Building
- **Algorithm Used**: `Logistic Regression`
  - Suitable for binary classification tasks
  - Interpretable and effective on linearly separable data

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations
- Can be extended to include:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integrate more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)
- Explore alternate models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines
- Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for live predictions
- Visualize model results and misclassifications for better interpretability
